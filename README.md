# GreenConfigurator
A university project where we create a website, that helps you configurate software systems by comparing the impact of a configuration on non-functional-properties like energy- and CPU-cost.
The website (http://pcai042.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~swt-p-2020-08/) is currently about one week of work older than the code you see on this GitHub Page. We are still working on this project until 15. of March 2021, but at the moment we are taking a short break of development due to the exams.

The team consists of 7 people, where everyone does a little bit of everything, but is specified on a specific area of the project. My main task was building the frontend with Vue.js and parts of the CI/CD pipeline over on GitLab, where we develop this project.
